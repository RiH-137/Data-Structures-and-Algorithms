## Logic

To minimize the time required for all four people to cross the bridge, we need to strategize the crossings efficiently.

Here's the optimal solution:

-The two fastest people (1-minute and 2-minutes) cross the bridge together. (2 minutes)
-The fastest person (1-minute) returns with the flashlight. (1 minute)
-The two slowest people (10-minutes and 5-minutes) cross the bridge together. (10 minutes)
-The second fastest person (2-minutes) returns with the flashlight. (2 minutes)
-The two fastest people (1-minute and 2-minutes) cross the bridge together again. (2 minutes)
Total time = 2 + 1 + 10 + 2 + 2 = 17 minutes

So, the minimum time required for all four to cross the bridge is 17 minutes.
