Fizzbuzz is one of the most basic problems in the coding interview world. Try to write a small and elegant code for this problem.

Given a positive integer A, return an array of strings with all the integers from 1 to N. 

But for multiples of 3 the array should have “Fizz” instead of the number. 

For the multiples of 5, the array should have “Buzz” instead of the number. 

For numbers which are multiple of 3 and 5 both, the array should have “FizzBuzz” instead of the number.

Look at the example for more details.

Example

A = 5
Return: [1 2 Fizz 4 Buzz]


SOLUTION:
class Solution:
    # @param A : integer
    # @return a list of strings
    def fizzBuzz(self, A):
        output = []
        if A <= 0: return output
        for i in range(1, A+1):
            if i % 3 == 0:
                if i % 5 == 0:
                    output.append('FizzBuzz')
                else:
                    output.append('Fizz')
            elif i % 5 == 0:
                output.append('Buzz')
            else:
                output.append(i)
        return output
