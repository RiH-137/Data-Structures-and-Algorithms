## NM / 2, NM / 2

This option involves breaking the chocolate bar into NM / 2 strips along one dimension and then breaking each strip into NM / 2 pieces along the other dimension. This results in a total of (NM / 2) + (NM / 2) breaks.

Breaking the chocolate bar into NM / 2 strips along one dimension requires NM / 2 - 1 breaks because each strip requires one less break than the number of blocks in that dimension.

Then, breaking each strip into N*M / 2 pieces along the other dimension doesn't require any additional breaks because each strip is already separated into individual blocks.

Thus, the total number of breaks needed for this option is (NM / 2) + (NM / 2), which equals NM - 1, the sufficient number of breaks needed to break the chocolate into NM 1 x 1 pieces.
