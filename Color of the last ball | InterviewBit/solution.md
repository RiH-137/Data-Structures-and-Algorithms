# Blue

## Logic

- You start with 20 blue balls and 14 red balls in a bag.
- You take out 2 balls at a time.
- If the two balls are the same color (both blue or both red), you add a blue ball back into the bag.
- If the two balls are different colors, you add a red ball back into the bag.
- You keep repeating this process until there's only one ball left in the bag.
Since you start with an even number of balls, and adding a blue ball keeps the total even, the last ball remaining will be blue.
