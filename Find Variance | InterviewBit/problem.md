Problem Description

Given an array A containing N integers, find the variance of the array. Return your answer up to 2 decimal points.


Problem Constraints

1 <= N <= 1000 1 <= A[i] <= 1000


Input Format

First argument is an integer, N, denoting the length of the input array Second line consists of N elements, separated by space


Output Format

Return a float value as specified in the question


Example Input

Input 1: N = 10 A = [99, 81, 4, 74, 9, 79, 45, 25, 44, 86]


Example Output

Output 1: 1034.64


Example Explanation

Mean = 54.6, simply apply the formula of variance to get 1034.64
