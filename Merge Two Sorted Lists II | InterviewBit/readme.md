# Problem Description
 
 

Given two sorted integer arrays A and B, merge B into A as one sorted array.

Note: You have to modify the array A to contain the merge of A and B. Do not output anything in your code.
TIP: C users, please malloc the result into a new array and return the result.

If the number of elements initialized in A and B is m and n respectively, the resulting size of array A after your code is executed should be m + n


Problem Constraints
1 <= |A|, |B| <= 105


Input Format
The first argument is an integer array A.
The second argument is an integer array B.


Output Format
Update the array A.


Example Input
A : [1 5 8]
B : [6 9]


Example Output
Modified A : [1 5 6 8 9]
