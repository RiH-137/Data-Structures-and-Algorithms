Problem Description:
Merge two sorted linked lists and return it as a new list. 

The new list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists, and should also be sorted.

For example, given following linked lists :

  5 -> 8 -> 20 
  4 -> 11 -> 15
The merged list should be :

4 -> 5 -> 8 -> 11 -> 15 -> 20

Solution:
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.next = None

class Solution:
    def mergeTwoLists(self, A, B):
        if A is None:
            return B
        if B is None:
            return A

        if A.val < B.val:
            A.next = self.mergeTwoLists(A.next, B)
            return A
        else:
            B.next = self.mergeTwoLists(A, B.next)
            return B
