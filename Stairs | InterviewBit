Problem Description:
You are climbing a stair case and it takes A steps to reach to the top.

Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?



Input Format:

The first and the only argument contains an integer A, the number of steps.
Output Format:

Return an integer, representing the number of ways to reach the top.



Solution:
class Solution:
    # @param A : integer
    # @return an integer
    def climbStairs(self, A):
        if A == 1:
            return 1
        elif A == 2:
            return 2
        step1, step2 = 1, 2
        for i in range(3, A + 1):
            current = step1 + step2
            step1, step2 = step2, current

        return step2
